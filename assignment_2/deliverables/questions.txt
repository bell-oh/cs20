1. The most satisfying part of this assignment was making the corners rounded 
on hover for the portfolio pieces on the home page. It was especially 
satisfying once I added a transition duration of half a second to make the
animation smooth.

2. The most challenging part of this assignment was making the responsive 
navigation menus in the header of the website. It was very difficult to keep
track of each element's display value since there were nested elements and
ultimately I had to use !important to make sure the hamburger menu would not
be displayed on larger screens.
