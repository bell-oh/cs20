1. Name one thing you like about using GitHub and one about using Cpanel hosting.
    What I like about GitHub hosting is how I don't have to manually upload any
    files when I make changes to them. I can just push my changes to GitHub and 
    my site will be updated.
    I like how cPanel hosting is fast and easy to use.
    
2. What was the most satisfying part of this assignment?
    The most satisfying part of this assignment was going to the URL and seeing
    my site there.
