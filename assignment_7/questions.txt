The most interesting part of the assignment was filtering the categories. It 
was very satisfying to hit the button and see the filtered products pop 
up on the page. I think this is a very useful feature to have on a website,
and I am glad I now know how to implement filtering so I could use similar
logic on my midterm or final project.
