1. XML is primarily used for transmitting data. You could use it to display a 
webpage of data about products, items, or people. You can style each part of
the data using CSS. With JSON, you can also store data about products, or
whatever else you want. You can turn JSON data into a string using JavaScript
and then display parts of the string in HTML. You often receive and parse
JSON data when interacting with APIs and network requests.

2. XML has the advantage of being very easily be styled using CSS. However, a 
disadvantage of XML is that it is very verbose. JSON uses much less text 
(and the file sizes are smaller), and smoothly integrates with JavaScript. 
I prefer JSON because of how compatible it is with JavaScript and how it is 
less wordy than XML. I find it very easy to read and understand JSON data.
